# autobot.money - A Solana tipping service for Twitter (more sites soon...)

autobot.money allows users to store their SOL in an open-source custodial web wallet service that they can either interface via a website or bt using the @autobotmoney twitter bot. This can, and most likely will be eventually extended to Discord and Telegram but since I'm crunched for time on the hackathon, I'm restricting this to Twitter for the moment.

This is not a defi protocol/app ☹️ but is a convenience service that should (in theory) strengthen the interactions between SOL fans on Twitter. Everyone loves a community that isn't afraid to share wealth with each other and that's the kind of community Solana should be building anyway. Free alpha for everyone!

## A brief overview of the service
