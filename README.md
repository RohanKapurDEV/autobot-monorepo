# autobot.money - A Solana tipping service for Twitter (more sites soon...)

autobot.money allows users to store their SOL in an open-source custodial web wallet service that they can interface either via Discord or Telegram.

This is not a defi protocol/app ☹️ but is a convenience service that should (in theory) make the interactions between people in Discord or Telegram chats more fun. Everyone loves a community that isn't afraid to share wealth with each other and that's the kind of community Solana should be building anyway.

## A brief overview of the service

`./discordBot.ts` - Main script that listens for mentions on twitter

`./telegramBot.ts` - Main script that listens for mentions on twitter
