# Soltipbot - A custodial Solana wallet with a Twitter interface

Soltipbot allows users to store their SOL in an open-source custodial web wallet service that they can either interface via a website or bt using the @soltipbot twitter bot. This can, and most likely will be eventually extended to Discord and Telegram but since I'm crunched for time on the hackathon, I'm restricting this to Twitter.

This is not a defi submission but is a convenience app that should (in theory) strengthen the interactions between SOL fans on Twitter.
